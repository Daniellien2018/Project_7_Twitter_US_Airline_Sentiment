# Project_7_Twitter_US_Airline_Sentiment
UT Austin AIML - Introduction to Natural Language Processing


## Description
Since the takeoff of Large Language Models, Sentiment Analysis has emerged as a top application in Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling businesses to gauge public opinion and improve customer experience. This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in airline-related tweets using the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative, providing insights into passenger satisfaction and airline service quality.

Using NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, word embeddings, and machine learning models, we will explore sentiment trends and compare different classifiers like logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning approaches. The results can help airlines improve customer relations by addressing common complaints and enhancing positive experiences. 

## Skills/Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding the distribution of sentiment labels, word frequencies, and key patterns in the dataset.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization), feature extraction, and sentiment classification.
- Sentiment Analysis – Identifying and classifying tweets as positive, neutral, or negative.
- Word Embeddings & Vectorization – Using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or Transformer-based embeddings to represent text numerically.
## Technologies 
- NumPy, Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization for sentiment distribution and feature analysis.
- NLTK, SpaCy – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Scikit-learn – Text vectorization (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer), traditional machine learning models.
- TensorFlow – Building deep learning models
